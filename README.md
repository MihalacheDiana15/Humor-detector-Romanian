# Humor-detector-Romanian

This experiment proposes an in-depth study of a machine learning system and pretrained transformer models aimed at classifying the humorous sentences published in Romanian, but it was later extended for a new task involving punchline position detection within the jokes and also comparing the results with LORA adapted models and the initial ones. 

A corpus of 2.400 manually annotated data was used, 50\% of which contain humor and the rest of them are reflecting natural conversations. The target audience for both the Reddit posts and the jokes consists of people aged 20â€“40, and the language used is colloquial. We then proceeded with conducting experiments: Dataset analysis, Syntax analysis, POS-tagging, followed by classical machine learning algorithms and transformer models (BERT). The best result is given by BERT models, especially XLM-RoBERTa, with an accuracy score of 98\%.
